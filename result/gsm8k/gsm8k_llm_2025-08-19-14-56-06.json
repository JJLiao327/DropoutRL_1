    "Question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "True Answer": "18",
    "Response": "After reviewing the analyses and results provided by the other agents, it is clear that they all arrived at the same conclusion regarding Janet's daily earnings from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market. \n\nThe steps taken by the agents are consistent and logical:\n\n1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins, totaling 7 eggs used.\n3. The remaining eggs available for sale are calculated by subtracting the used eggs from the total laid eggs: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n4. Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, resulting in a total income of 9 * 2 = $18.\n\nAll agents have followed this reasoning accurately, confirming that Janet makes $18 daily from selling her remaining duck eggs. \n\nThus, the final result is:\n\nThe answer is 18",
