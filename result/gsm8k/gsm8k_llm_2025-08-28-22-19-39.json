    "True Answer": "#### 10",
    "Response": "After reviewing the analysis and results provided by the other agents, it appears that there is a clear and straightforward solution to this problem.\n\nAgents 8NjN, 3MFY, and 5vj2 have all broken down the problem into logical steps and arrived at the same conclusion: Paige had 11 songs initially, deleted 9 old songs, and then added 8 new songs, resulting in a total of 10 songs on her mp3 player.\n\nThe approach used by these agents is consistent and easy to follow, making their solutions the most reliable. The other agent, 4p3h, has provided a different problem statement, which is not relevant to the question at hand.\n\nTherefore, based on the clear and logical analysis provided by agents 8NjN, 3MFY, and 5vj2, the final result is:\n\nThe answer is 10",

    "Question": "There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut?",
    "True Answer": "#### 17",
    "Response": "After reviewing the analysis and results provided by the other agents, it appears that there is a clear and straightforward solution to the problem.\n\nAgents 8NjN, 4p3h, 5vj2, and 3MFY have all correctly identified the total number of students trying out for the team as 43 (39 girls + 4 boys) and the number of students who got called back as 26.\n\nThe calculation to find the number of students who didn't make the cut is also consistent across all agents: 43 (total students) - 26 (students called back) = 17 students.\n\nTherefore, the most reliable answer is that 17 students didn't make the cut.\n\nThe answer is 17",
