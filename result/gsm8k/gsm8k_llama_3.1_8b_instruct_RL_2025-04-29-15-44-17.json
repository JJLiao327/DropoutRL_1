        "True Answer": "72",
        "Response": "After reviewing the analysis and results provided by the other agents, it is clear that the problem can be solved through a simple arithmetic operation.\n\nAgent 8heH, 3UVX, and 8L5t have all arrived at the same solution, which is that Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May. This is achieved by first calculating the number of clips sold in May as half of the number sold in April, which is 24, and then adding this to the number sold in April, which is 48.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward, and the results are consistent across all agents. \n\nTherefore, based on the analysis and results provided, the final answer is:\n\nThe answer is 72",
