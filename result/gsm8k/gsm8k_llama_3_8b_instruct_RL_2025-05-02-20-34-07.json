        "Question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?",
        "True Answer": "72",
        "Response": "After reviewing the analysis and results provided by the other agents, it appears that there is a straightforward mathematical approach to solving this problem.\n\nAgent 6t4B has broken down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Natalia sold 48 clips in April.\n2. She sold half as many clips in May, which would be 48 / 2 = 24 clips.\n\nTo find the total number of clips sold, we add the number of clips sold in April and May: 48 + 24 = 72.\n\nAgent 8J7A and 2a1e have also arrived at the same correct solution using similar calculations.\n\nTherefore, the most reliable answer is that Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.\n\nThe answer is 72",

        "Question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
        "True Answer": "10",
        "Response": "A: Based on the analysis and results provided by the other agents, it is clear that there is a difference in approaches to solving this problem. Agents 7fMZ, 7LQz, and 6ccf have all correctly calculated the number of hours Weng worked (0.83 hours) and then used this value to calculate her earnings.\n\nHowever, Agent 6ccf's approach is the most straightforward and easy to follow. By first calculating the earnings per minute ($0.20) and then multiplying this by the number of minutes worked, Agent 6ccf's solution is the most reliable and efficient.\n\nThe final result, based on the most reliable approach, is an earnings of $10.\n\nThe answer is 10",
